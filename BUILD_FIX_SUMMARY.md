# Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

The TypeScript compilation error has been fixed:

```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'minimatch'.
The file is in the program because:
  Entry point for implicit type library 'minimatch'
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Root Cause
The error occurred because:
- TypeScript compiler was looking for the `@types/minimatch` type definitions
- These types are referenced by `@types/node` as a transitive dependency
- The types were not explicitly declared in devDependencies

### 2. Solution Applied
Added `@types/minimatch` to the devDependencies in `package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@types/minimatch": "^5.1.2",
  // ... other dependencies
}
```

### 3. Additional Fixes

#### Sample App Configuration
- **Updated `examples/sample-app/package.json`**: Changed the library reference from `"file:../.."` to `"file:../../dist"` to correctly point to the built library
- **Updated `examples/sample-app/tsconfig.app.json`**: Changed extends from `../../tsconfig.json` to `./tsconfig.json` to use the correct TypeScript configuration

## How to Build and Run

### Step 1: Build the Library

```bash
# From the repository root
npm install
npm run build
```

The library will be built to the `dist/` folder.

### Step 2: Run the Sample App

```bash
# Navigate to sample app
cd examples/sample-app

# Install dependencies (links to ../../dist automatically)
npm install

# Start the development server
# For Node.js 14-16:
npm start

# For Node.js 17+:
NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

### Step 3: Build Sample App for Production

```bash
# From examples/sample-app/
# For Node.js 14-16:
npm run build:prod

# For Node.js 17+:
NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" npm run build:prod
```

The production build will be in `dist/sample-app/`

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added:

- **[LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Complete guide for local development
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Updated with Node.js requirements
- **[examples/sample-app/README.md](./examples/sample-app/README.md)** - Updated with correct paths

## Node.js Compatibility

âœ… **Node.js 14.x - 16.x**: Fully supported, no workarounds needed

âœ… **Node.js 17+**: Supported with the `NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"` flag

The workaround for Node.js 17+ is needed because of OpenSSL 3.0 changes that affect webpack (used by Angular CLI).

## Verification

Both builds have been verified successfully:

- âœ… Library builds without errors
- âœ… Sample app installs and links to the library correctly
- âœ… Sample app builds without errors
- âœ… All type definitions are properly resolved

## Quick Reference Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install library deps | `npm install` |
| Build library | `npm run build` |
| Install sample app deps | `cd examples/sample-app && npm install` |
| Run sample app (Node 14-16) | `npm start` |
| Run sample app (Node 17+) | `NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" npm start` |
| Build sample app | `npm run build:prod` |

## Next Steps

You can now:

1. âœ… Build the library locally with `npm run build`
2. âœ… Run the sample app on localhost with `npm start`
3. âœ… Make changes to the library and test them in the sample app
4. âœ… Build for Tizen with `npm run build:tizen`
5. âœ… Build for webOS with `npm run build:webos`

No publishing to npm or any other registry is required!

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems:

1. Check [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions
2. Review the [Troubleshooting section](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting)
3. Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version
4. Make sure to rebuild the library after pulling the latest changes
